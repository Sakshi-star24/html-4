		<img src="download (1).jpg" alt="Fashion Designers" width="104><p>Born in 1999, the roots of our FASHION DESIGNERS are in Rajasthan, India.</p><br>
		<p>Fashion Designers' founder, Sakshi Gupta, established the brand at her kitchen table, with 5 crore rupees by all her savings. Her sister designed our instantly-recognisable logo, and the name “Fashion Designers” came from the idea of all of her passion. All of this represented a love towards fashion, the importance of fashion and the growth of a fundamentally Indian brand.</p>
		<p>The first designs were buckled leather belts - soon, other accessories followed, including iconic bags and a womenswear line in 2002. The hallmarks of these Fashion Designers creations - timeless design coupled with traditional quality and a sense of the here and now - are the threads that run through everything we make. Then, today and tomorrow.</p>
